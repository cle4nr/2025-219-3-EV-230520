        <p>Inside the video attached below, I explain why my project meets every basic and advanced requirement included
            in the brief.</p>

    <h1>Investigation</h1>

    <div>
        <p>Initially, I was planning on researching and analyzing marriage, birth, and death rates in Ireland. However,
            as I delved into this topic, I soon realized that there simply isn’t much substantial data to
            display on graphs. I discovered that this particular topic really doesn’t
            interest me at all. <br><br>

            After struggling to decide on one topic, I took some time to think about the things that interest me. As
            someone who
            often listens to a wide range of genres, I thought about making an
            interactive information system focused on spotify songs, artists, and genres.
            However, after more consideration, I decided against this idea because I felt that the topic
            would result in an information system that lacked the originality I was looking for in my
            project. <br><br>

            In the end, I settled on the dataset of UFC fighter statistics. This dataset interests me the most
            because I am a fan of the sport and martial arts in general, I even train martial arts. Additionally, there
            is lots of different types of data
            that I can display, including various metrics regarding the fighters' body mechanics. The topic of optimal
            physiques in different sports has always interested me. For example, in the sport of basketball, as the hoop
            is high up, taller players dominate the sport. This leaves shorter players to not make it far in the sport,
            more often than not. Seeing that data regarding body mechanics is included in the dataset, I thought that I
            could analyse what type of physique is best for MMA fighting under the UFC ruleset.
            Another upside of this dataset is that it contains a list of over 4,000 fighters, dating all the way back to the year 1993.
            This means I will have a larger and more accurate sample size for the averages of different types of data in each division.  <br><br>
            The target demographic for my interactive information system will be UFC and MMA fans, those individuals who
            are curious  to explore which fighters and weight classes boast the best statistics in different
            areas. For example, they might ask questions such as, “Which weight class has the highest ape index?” or
            “Which weight class contains the most Southpaw fighters?” This focus not only aligns with my interests but
            also allows me to engage with a passionate community that is equally enthusiastic about gaining deeper
            insights into the sport.
        </p>
    </div><br><br>
    <h1>Plan and design</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I plan to have 2 python files, and 2 html files. The first python file will extract the raw data from my csv
            file, clean this raw data by removing all whitespace as I cannot analyse missing data, and removing illegal
            characters which prevent the data from
            being pushed to firebase. <br><br>

            Then I would store this clean, usable data on Firebase to be analysed next. The second python file will pull
            the clean data from Firebase to
            analyse the data within the different weight classes and visualise this data using multiple matplotlib
            graphs. <br><br>
            The first html file will be for my main website,
            index.html, in which I will pull the data analysed in the second python file, store this data as lists, and
            display this data on
            the
            graphs I created using the matplotlib plugin on python. But instead, I would use chart.js instead of
            matplotlib and transform at least 2 of the graphs into
            interactive
            graphs. I plan on making a pie chart that allows you to pick the individual weight division that the chart
            displays. On change, the website will seamlessly change the pie chart to display data of another weight
            division. I plan on having a double bar chart that allows you to enable and disable the different types of
            data.
            At the end of this webpage, I will include my recommendations tab which will include the user being prompted
            by
            multiple questions which returns the user with 2 separate pieces of information relating to the topic of my
            dataset. <br><br>In my second html file, I will have a survey form, and at least 2 graphs that are comprised of data
            entered by the user relating to martial arts and the ultimate fighting championship. <br><br> I plan to maintain a
            very
            simple colour scheme for both my websites. I would include boxes around all text, and make sure text does
            not spread across the entire webpage laterally, as it weakens user experience having to move their eyes back
            and forth. For the index html file I would like to include paragraps of text which explain the graphs below
            and the importance of this data. I would like to have very subtle background images as to not overload the
            viewers eyes.</p>

        <h1>Progress Log</h1>

        <ul>
            <h1>Week 1</h1>
            <li>I researched existing systems and topics I may be interested in, I identified the UFC as my topic.
            </li>
            <h1>Week 2</h1>
            <li>I cleaned the data from the csv file and uploaded it to Firebase to be used for analysis. </li>
            <h1>Week 3</h1>
            <li>I started to display the data I cleaned on graphs using matplotlib </li>
            <li>The first graphs I made were to
                compare 2 fighters against each other and display a certain part of their data next to each other on a
                bar chart. </li>
            <h1>Week 4</h1>
            <li>I developed more graphs to display data on fighters’ heights, reaches and their fighting stances. </li>
            <li>I
                was testing out which type of charts I wolid like to use on my future website. </li>
            <h1>Week 5</h1>
            <li> I finished creating the graphs and sent the reslit of my analysis I used to create these graphs to
                Firebase to be used on the website. </li>
            <h1>Week 6</h1>
            <li>I began working on the website, it took me a while to overcome errors I encountered receiving data from
                Firebase, but then I was able to turn my data from Firebase into usable lists for my graphs. </li>
            <h1>Week 7</h1>
            <li>I created the graphing functions for my bar charts and my line chart. I made two separate bar charts to
                display height and reach. </li>
            <h1>Week 8</h1>
            <li>I started working on the interactive pie chart, but ran into issues with the canvas being reused, so I
                had to find a way to create a new canvas and add it to a dictionary to be checked if it’s existing.
            </li>
            <li>This
                allowed me to change the graph I was displaying in the same spot on the web page. </li>
            <li>I also created the
                suggestions page at the end of my website. </li>
            <h1>Week 9</h1>
            <li>I began working on my survey page, I created the form and sent it to Firebase but did not make graphs.
            </li>
            <li>I also went back and combined my two bar charts into a single bar chart on my main website </li>
            <h1>Week 10</h1>
            <li>I went back to python and removed my graphs that compared two chosen fighters and replaced it with a bar
                chart that compares the average ape indexes of each weight class. </li>
            <li>I sent this data to Firebase to be
                displayed on the website too. </li>
            <li>I made the reach and height bar chart interactive allowing you to toggle
                which data was displayed. </li>
            <li>I also wrote the code that takes the survey’s information from firebase to be
                graphed. </li>
            <h1>Week 11</h1>
            <li>I focused on making both websites more visually pleasing, changing fonts & colours, and adding boxes and
                background images. </li>
            <h1>Week 12</h1>
            <li>I tested my code on another computer from a zip file, I wrote the paragraphs that made the website more
                user friendly, and I linked the survey to the main website at the top of the page. </li>
            <li>I also recorded my
                final video on OBS. </li>



        </ul>

    </div><br>
    <div>
        <h1>Form Validation Truth Table</h1>
        <p>While testing the integrity of my form validation javascript code, I used a truth table to ensure incorrect
            data was not pushed to firebase when submitted. Every part of my form validation code worked as expected.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h1>A problem I overcame</h1>
        <p>When I was first writing the code to display my data pulled from firebase on chart.js graphs, I used
            dictionaries to store the analysed data I was sending to Firebase. One drawback of using dictionaries that I
            discovered, is that Firebase automatically sorts the keys of a dictionary alphabetically. This means that my
            bar & line charts x-axises were labelled alphabetically, as opposed to being sorted from lightest to
            heaviest weight class. This meant that these graphs did not rise from left to right, and looked more as if
            there was no relationship between the x-axis and y-axis. Below I will show a snippet of the code that stored
            the
            analytics as dictionaries.</p>
        <img src="materials//PreviousCode.png" alt="Previous Data Storage Code">
        <p>In order to overcome this problem, instead of storing my data as dictionaries that sort alphabetically when
            pushed to firebase, I store the data as lists which are not sorted meaning the x-axis of my bar and line
            charts are ordered the way I intended, being from lowest to highest weight. Changing the code so that I
            store the data in lists as opposed to dictionaries was quite simple, I changed the way that I first define
            the variable from = dict(), to = list(). Then instead of assigning a key value pair, I use the python append
            function to add each piece of data in order of the weight of the data's weight class. You may notice that I
            also removed 3 lines of code that replaced whitespace with 'n/a'. I didn't remove the code, but instead I
            moved it to the correct file, being the file in which I cleaned the raw data.
            Below I will show a snippet of my updated code.</p>
        <img src="materials//UpdatedCode.png" alt="Updated Data Storage Code">
    </div><br>
    <div>
        <h1>An Analytics Algorithm I designed</h1>
        <p>Below I display both the code that defines my algorithmic function, and the code that applies said function.
            This algorithm sorts each fighter and their data into the weight classes in which they belong. It adds these
            fighters to a 2D dictionary as a key-value pair. The function named "weightcheck" has a single paramater,
            which is the weight of a given fighter. The function takes this weight value returns a number from 1-8,
            which each represent one of the eight men's weight classes in the UFC. <br><br>
            The second snippet of code below is the application of the weightcheck function. It is a for loop that
            checks what number from 1-8 is returned by the fighter's weight value, and adds the fighter and their
            data into the dictionary represented by the returned numerical value, each dictionary is named after the
            abbreviation of its weight class, for example, the dictionary
            that contained the names and data of fighters in the light heavyweight division would be named 'lhw'.

            goes through every fighter's weight in the dataset, and adds the fighter and their
            data into a dictionary that is named after the abbreviation of its weight class, for example, the dictionary
            that contained the names and data of fighters in the light heavyweight division would be named 'lhw'.
            <br><br>
            This algorithm allows for me to then run these dictionaries through for loops to take the average of one
            datapoint
            and add it to a list to be displayed on a graph.
        </p>

    <br><br>
    <h1>Evaluation</h1>
    <div>
        <p>As displayed in the embedded video, I covered all of the brief's basic and advanced requirements. My project
            completed its intended goals to a high standard in my opinion, but I personally believe that I would
            appreciate my webpage from a
            viewer's perspective more if I analyzed and displayed more individual fighters’ data, as opposed to simply
            comparing the averages in the divisions. I believed it would have been harder to display individual
            fighters’ data on graphs as there are so many fighters in the organization, but it would be more interesting
            and engaging if I managed to figure out a method to do such a thing. I found an example of this type of
            website in the Fighter
            Deep Dive tab of MMA Insights, which will be linked in my references. In this website,
            you can see all important statistics of a chosen fighter, including the fighter's previous fights. I thought
            of doing this, but the only way I could imagine making something like this myself, is if I were to use a
            dataset that included all fights in UFC history. I even found datasets similar to what I have just
            described, but I found these datasets to be complex and unreliable, they were missing a lot of important
            data types that I wanted to analyse. <br><br>

            To develop this interactive webpage further, I would return to my original idea in which I compared two
            fighters' data to see which fighter was superior in a given field. I believe this would have made for a more
            entertaining webpage for the user, as it provides a more objective outlook on individual fighters. By
            incorporating an interactive feature that allows the user to compare two fighters
            the user could choose specific metrics to compare, leading to a more tailored experience.
            Including visualizations such as side-by-side bar charts or scatterplot graphs could enhance user
            engagement.
            These enhancements would not only inform the viewer but also encourage exploration and
            discussion within the MMA community.
